# Building the Car of the Future ---- Using-Linear-regression

For this project, we are given the car data (car.cvs dataset) with attributes of vehicle such as MPG, Cylinder, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, etc. To assist the car manufacturer on designing an energy efficient car, we are planning to build a model that would help us determine which attributes may contribute to higher gas mileage so that they can design a more fuel-efficient automobile.

There are three parts needed to be complete in this project:

Part 1:
Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.

Part 2:
Build a linear regression model to accurately predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on the attributes of a vehicle. Discuss the significant attributes and how they can help you build the proper car.

Part 3:
Optimize the model using selection techniques, explain whether the model can achieve the specified goals, and describe which attributes contribute to higher MPG over others.

Both of these three parts will be completed using Python on Jupyter Notebook. Necessary codes and visuals will be attached directly within the report, and the full python script is in another file.
